# stock-analysis
 In this assignment, I have written a series of codes that, when executed, take a large workbook of stock data and simplify it into easy-to-grab pieces of relevant information. The data has been broken down as follows: 
 
1. For each year (worksheet) across a three-year span (workbook) I have condensed the data into a yearly change, percent changed, and the total stock volume for each individial stock ticker.
2. I further condensed the information into a relevant summary table stating which ticker had the highest % gain, the highest % lost, and the greatest total stock volume for each year.


I wrote the entirety of this code myself. However, I did utilize the AI engine ChatGPT.com to clean up a few pieces of syntax/organization and identify errors in the code.
